Description: The INTERGROWTH-21st Project is a multi-centre, multi-ethnic, 
    population-based project, conducted between 2009 and 2014, in eight 
    demarcated urban areas: Pelotas, Brazil; Shunyi County, Beijing, China; 
    Central Nagpur, India; Turin, Italy; Parklands Suburb, Nairobi, Kenya; 
    Muscat, Oman; Oxford, UK, and Seattle, USA. Its primary aim was to study 
    growth, health, nutrition and neuro-development from less than 14 weeks of 
    gestation to 2 years of age, using the same conceptual framework as the WHO 
    Multicentre Growth Reference Study, so as to produce international 
    prescriptive standards for pregnancy dating, maternal weight gain, fetal 
    growth, newborn size, the postnatal growth of preterm infants and cognitive 
    development at 2 years of age. These scientifically robust clinical tools 
    may be used to monitor and evaluate maternal and fetal well-being, as well 
    as infant health and nutrition at an individual and population level.
